Open NC File is a versatile and unrestricted tool designed to extract time series data from NetCDF files. It effortlessly opens and reads data from any type of NetCDF file, including those with rotated-pole grids, such as CORDEX data. Users can input a list of station coordinates manually or via a text file, Excel file, or CSV file.

A key feature of Open NC File is its ability to temporarily merge NetCDF files in unlimited dimensions. Users can specify the name of the unlimited dimension if it is not predefined in the file. Additionally, the tool provides an API that displays the stations and the domain of the NetCDF file on a map (for 1-dimensional lat/lon), making it easier to visualize the spatial distribution of stations.

Open NC File works seamlessly with NetCDF files that have three or two dimensions, automatically detecting and using the latitude and longitude dimensions. If these dimensions are not automatically detected, users can manually enter them in text boxes.

The tool efficiently handles NetCDF files with a time dimension and can merge files using the time dimension if one is absent. For <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/open_nc_file_for_coordinates" target="_blank">NetCDF files</a> with four dimensions, users can easily select a specific element of the fourth dimension.

In conclusion, Open NC File is a powerful and user-friendly tool that simplifies the extraction of time series data from NetCDF files. It caters to a wide range of file configurations and allows users to interact with their data effectively.

The Open NC File tool has undergone rigorous testing by AgriMetSoft's team using various <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/open_nc_file_for_coordinates" target="_blank">NetCDF</a> files. We are pleased to announce that the tool successfully opened all tested files and extracted data without any issues, proving it to be a reliable and effective solution for extracting time series from NetCDF files.
